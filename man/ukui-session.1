.SH "NAME"
ukui-session \- Start the UKUI Desktop Environment.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.B ukui-session [OPTIONS]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The \fBukui-session\fP program starts up the UKUI desktop environment. This command is typically executed by your Login/Display Manager (like GDM, LXDM, XDM, SLiM, or from your X startup scripts like .xinitrc). It will load either your saved session, or it will provide a default session for the user as defined by the system administrator (or the default UKUI installation on your system).
.PP
The default session is defined in the dconf keys under
.BI / org / ukui / desktop / session /
.br
When saving a session, \fBukui-session\fP saves the currently running applications in the \fB~/.config/ukui-session/saved-session\fP directory of the users /home.
.PP
\fBukui-session\fP is an X11 session manager. It can manage UKUI applications as well as any other X11 SM compliant ones.

.SH "OPTIONS"
.SS The following options are supported:
.TP
\fB\-a, \-\-autostart=DIR\fR
Start all applications defined in "\fBDIR\fP", instead of starting the applications defined in 
.BI / org / ukui / desktop / session / default\-session
.br
Multiple \fB\-\-autostart\fP options can be passed.
.TP
\fB\-f, \-\-failsafe\fR
Run in fail-safe mode. User-specified applications will not be started.
.TP

.TP

.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
.SS \fBukui-session\fP sets several environment variables for the use of its child processes:
.PP
.B "SESSION_MANAGER"
.IP
This variable is used by session-manager aware clients to contact ukui-session.
.PP
.B "DISPLAY"
.IP
This variable is set to the X display being used by \fBukui-session\fP. Note that if the \-\-display option is used this might be different from the setting of the environment variable when ukui-session is invoked.

.SH "FILES"
.PP
.nf
.B ~/.config/autostart
.B /usr/share/autostart
.B /usr/share/ukui/autostart
